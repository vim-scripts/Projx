 projx is a simple to install, light weight project explorer plugin. It opens a project navigation panel on  the right/left side of the vim screen. When enter is pressed on a file name the file is opened in a new tab or jumps to an existing tab that already has the file
                                                                                       
 It supports project wide grep that will show all the instances in the quickfix window. 
                                                                                       
 When enabled, it automatically creates and updates tag file for the list of files in the project.

 Works well with cppnav plugin

USAGE:
 To use this plugin, simply place a .projx file in the root of working directory with all the file names (with relative path) in the project (one per line)
                                                                                       
 :Projx [<project file>] to open or close the project navigation panel. Optionally specify the project file name to this command.
                                                                                       
 :Pgrep <regx> to search for a string across all the files in the project. Results are listed in the quickfix window. Preview/jump to the location using p or <enter> keys.
                                                                                       
 :Ptags to update the tag file. This plugin automatically updates the tag file on init (if any of the file is newer than the tag file)
                                                                                       
 :Pfilter <wildcard expression> to see only the specific files on the navigation panel
                                                                                       
OPTIONS:
 Set the following variables in .vimrc/_vimrc file to control some of the options. 
                                                                                       
 let g:projx_file_def = <default project file name>           " .projx is used by default
 let g:projx_right_win = <1/0>                                            " use right/left navigation panel
 let g:projx_win_size = xxx                                                 " set the navigation panel width to xxx
 let g:projx_ctag_path = <ctag executable name/path> " omit this to disable tab file creation
